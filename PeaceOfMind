    Super frustrated, Been working on Calling an API for 3 hours and I have not got it to work. I know i could be using Javascript that will be a lot easier but I want to use JAva which is a pain for me because I have not used it before. I am not sure why i am writing this not, honestly its just to get the github stupid counter, because if i didn't do this it would look like i didn't work and I would like to have something positive. I am going to be continuing to work on this but for now I am stepping away. I thought I was onto something but It did not work like that.
