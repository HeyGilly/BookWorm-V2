    Super frustrated, Been working on Calling an API for 3 hours and I have not got it to work. I know i could be using Javascript that will be a lot easier but I want to use JAva which is a pain for me because I have not used it before. I am not sure why i am writing this not, honestly its just to get the github stupid counter, because if i didn't do this it would look like i didn't work and I would like to have something positive. I am going to be continuing to work on this but for now I am stepping away. I thought I was onto something but It did not work like that.

    - I guess I am just going to leave these notes as just personal notes through my journey. I am not sure where this is going to lead to but here it goes.
    - Today's goal:
        - Fix the duplicate genres that are in the welcome page. (BOOM FIXED)
        - I need to implement the api so i can start moving on, If i can not find out how to do it with java then i am just gonna use hava script. I am frustrated on that but my question is now it is typical to just use javascript. does anyone use Java to call a api?

    - Notes:
        - I think i  found the solution thanks to rapidApi (https://rapidapi.com/guides/make-api-call-java). Read it .

    - Took me most of the day to figure out how to not change the URL when i submit for a book  result.
    - I did add a loader so when the book is searching I can have a custom spinner to show it is doing something and the user just dont think we froze.
    - I will have to go back and look over the code again to make sure I fully understand but I think that is later on.
